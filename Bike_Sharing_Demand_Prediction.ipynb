        "## **Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Bike Sharing Demand Prediction** project aims to develop a machine learning regression model that accurately forecasts the demand for bike rentals in Seoul, South Korea. This project utilizes the SeoulBikeData dataset, which contains valuable information about bike rentals, weather conditions, and temporal factors. The goal is to build a robust predictive model that can assist bike rental services in efficiently managing their inventory and meeting customer demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Dataset Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "The SeoulBikeData dataset comprises data collected over a period of time, with features such as date, hour, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. These features are crucial in understanding the underlying patterns and factors influencing bike rental demand. The dataset will be preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and perform feature engineering to extract meaningful information.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Methodology**\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step is to clean and prepare the data for model training. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Additionally, outliers will be identified and addressed to prevent them from adversely affecting model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Feature Engineering\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving the predictive power of the model. New features such as day of the week, time of day, and weather indicators will be created to capture temporal and environmental patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Selection and Training\n",
        "\n",
        "Several regression algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, will be considered for this project. Each model will be trained and evaluated using techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness and avoid overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "The performance of the models will be assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to gauge their accuracy in predicting bike rental demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Expected Outcomes**\n",
        "\n",
        "Upon successful completion of this project, we anticipate achieving a reliable regression model that accurately predicts bike rental demand in Seoul. The insights gained from this model will empower bike rental services to make data-driven decisions about inventory management, pricing strategies, and resource allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Impact and Future Work**\n",
        "\n",
        "The implementation of an accurate demand prediction model has the potential to significantly benefit bike rental services. By optimizing resource allocation, they can reduce operational costs and improve customer satisfaction. Furthermore, this project lays the foundation for future enhancements, including real-time prediction capabilities and integration with additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the Bike Sharing Demand Prediction project aims to create a valuable tool for the bike rental industry in Seoul, enabling them to make informed decisions and enhance their services. Through careful data analysis, feature engineering, and model selection, we anticipate delivering a robust solution that contributes to the efficiency and success of bike rental businesses."

        "1. Performance Metrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lowest Errors: The Random Forest Regression with Grid Search CV has the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) compared to other models. This indicates that it makes predictions with the least amount of deviation from the actual values.\n",

Notably, Rented Bike Count is influenced by features such as the season (Seasons_Winter, Seasons_Summer), time of day (Hour_X features), and weather conditions (Humidity(%), Wind speed (m/s), Visibility (10m), Solar Radiation (MJ/m2)).\n",
